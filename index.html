        <h2>My Story 🌸</h2>
            <p> I've always been someone with way too many hobbies (and somehow still want to add more), but if there's one thing that's been a constant in my life, it's <strong>gaming</strong>! I've been playing games for as long as I can remember...literally since I was a toddler. Some of my earliest memories are sitting in front of the TV with my dad and brothers, switching between the old Nintendo and the PlayStation 2. We'd spend hours playing Super Mario Bros and Mario Kart on the Wii, Sonic, and even random classics from the Namco Museum series. </p>

            </figure>
            <p>Overtime, I started to explore more complex games and genres, and my love for gaming only deepened. These days gaming is a significant part of my life, and I enjoy playing a wide variety of games on different platforms, with my top two being PC and Playstation 5. Being able to play videogames has allowed me to meet new people and experience stories in a way that books and movies can't quite capture. Don't get me wrong, I <i>LOVE</i> reading; I almost centered this project around books, but gaming just feels more personal to me. While I surfed through my memory, I just realized that different games have marked different stages of my life, and my passion for reading did not kick off until I was about 11 years old. </p>

            <p> People have their own opinions about how videogames impact today's generation, good and bad, and every experience differs from person to person. For me, videogames are part of who I am. </p>

            <h2>My Favorite Games 🎮</h2>
                <p>I have many games that I love, but these are just a few from the main genres that I play! I enjoy a variety of game genres, including open-world RPGs, farming simulators, sandbox games, and tactical shooters. Each game has unique experiences and gives me something new to hyperfixiate over.</p>

        <h2>Why I Love Gaming ❤️</h2>
            <p>After a long day of work and classes, I almost always end up gaming. It's one of my favorite way to unwind; sometimes I'll play solo just to relax with some me-time, and other times I hop on with friends for a few hours of fun. There are so many different kinds of games out there, and everyone has their own taste, but somehow we all find ways to connect through it. Talking, laughing, and bonding with people who love the same things you do? One of the best feelings <i>ever</i>.<br>

            <br>When COVID hit, gaming honestly kept me sane. Everything felt so hopeless and lonesome, but watching and playing games like Minecraft and Among Us made things feel a little more normal, gave me an outlet. I still remember those nights staying up way too late, building random stuff in Minecraft or arguing that "it's REALLY not me" in Among Us. It was silly, but it gave me a way to escape and still feel close to people when we couldn't be together in person.</p>

                <figcaption class="image-caption"> Me playing<a href="https://playvalorant.com/en-us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> Valorant</a>, a game that I have a <strong>STRONG</strong> love-hate relationship with.</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <p>These days, gaming is still that safe little escape for me. It's where I can leave behind the stress of the day, jump into another world, and just have fun being competitive or creative. It sounds a bit cliche, but it's reality for me. I've always had a bit of a competitive streak, which is how I ended up joining my high school's varsity Valorant team. The people I met there became some of my closest friends, and honestly, I can't imagine my life without them now.<br>

            <br>Gaming has been a part of my life through some of the hardest and happiest moments. It's my comfort space and my way to connect, the thing that never fails to make my day a little better. So much so that I decided to start <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/sncloo" class="links" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="THIS IS NOT A PROMOTION. ONLY LINKED THIS TO SHOW MY PASSION.">my own content creation journey</a> this past summer! Having this passion has pushed me to create a comfort space for others to sit and hang if they'd like, and so far I'm <i>loving</i> it.</p><br>
        
            <p>So yeah! Gaming isn't just what I do, it's kind of who I am. It's been with me through every stage of life, and I don't plan on putting it down anytime soon. 💖</p>
